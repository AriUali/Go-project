I'm editing pages all pages, add block shadows and another design things into code 
Because before my css wasn't work .Then I am adding more about rating before it was like write number and now you can choose the one option:
---one, two or five stars.
Then working on my database adding all needed columns. I am understand the meaning of primary key and not null values because in my code were
errors like: impossible to add or edit, so it was important to make ID of products primary key and  auto increment.

ALTER TABLE `productdb`.`products` 
CHANGE COLUMN `comments` `comments` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL ,
CHANGE COLUMN `rating` `rating` INT NOT NULL ;

as soon as it is my last report, I  am working on debugging my code last two weeks. There is no new functions but new design and more usable site.
