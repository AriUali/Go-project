As soon as I’m using Python for coding it take me some time to learn new syntax.
So I did not do a lot about the project but I’m loaded my little coding files.
Also I’m working alone and my project will be about e-Commerce or something related 
to the online ordering. I’m going to use postgres or Oracle(use cursors and triggers if it is possible)
